This is my first Odin Project project! I'm supposed to be recreat a simple version of the google.com homepage by applying some of the new HTML and CSS skills they have gone over. 

Things I'm hoping to learn !
    0. How to apply HTML and CSS in practice rather than just reading it. 
    1. A better understanding of class and id tags. 
    2. How everything comes together once a website/page is complete.
    3. How to use devtools in a real world application.
