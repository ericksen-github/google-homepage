This is my first Odin Project project! I'm supposed to be recreating a simple version of the google.com homepage by applying some of the new HTML and CSS skills they have gone over. 

Things I'm hoping to learn !
    0. How to apply HTML and CSS in practice rather than just reading it. 
    1. A better understanding of class and id tags. 
    2. How everything comes together once a website/page is complete.
    3. How to use devtools in a real world application. 


Thoughts after finishing the home page
    0. Definitely more challenging than I first thought. Getting the CSS portion to have links and logos line up correctly was the big challenge.
    1. I used both on this project. Best I can tell, use class when you have more than one thing you need to manipulate using the same criteria. Otherwise, id works just fine too. 
    2. It was neat watching everything take shape. Lots to learn still!
    3. Devtools definitely made certain parts easier. I can see why you would manipulate values there first when doing design. It was also       handy to peak in on the actual Google homepage to see what I need to do.
